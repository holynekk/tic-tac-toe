# tic-tac-toe

The Odin Project tic-tac-toe

[LIVE DEMO](https://holynekk.github.io/tic-tac-toe/index.html)


Very basic tic-tac-toe game built with JS/HTML/CSS against unbeatable computer player.
Computer uses minimax algorithm to determine which square it will put its symboll.

# Instructions
- At first, player should choose a game mode (player vs player || player vs computer), then start to play.
- In player vs player mode, each player put symbols on grid in their turn and eventually, game determines which player won.
- There is no chance to win against computer, if you try hard it will do so, and if there is a chance for it to win, he will win :). Basically, it's **unbeatable**.
